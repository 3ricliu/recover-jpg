# recover-jpg
CS50 PSet4: C Program which attempts to recover JPGs from a file containing "deleted" JPGs.

For the Problem Set, CS50 provided a card.raw file, which the JPGs are to be recovered from.
"card.raw" was manually coded into recover.c, to be the designated file which the program executes on, to try and recover JPGs.

"card.raw" can be viewed and downloaded from: https://github.com/CoreData/cs50/blob/master/pset4/jpg/card.raw
